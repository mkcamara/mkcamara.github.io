                <h3>Observability Issues in Decision Theory</h3>

                <h5>September 8, 2019.</h5>

                <p><i>Disclaimer: there are many people I respect and consider friends who would disagree with what I'm about to write.

                <p>It has been just over eight decades since Paul Samuelson, as a graduate student, outlined the program that would come to dominate economic thought <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Samuelson, P. A. (1938). A note on the pure theory of consumer’s behaviour. Economica, 5(17), 61–71.')">(Samuelson 1938)</span>. The promise of <i>revealed preference</i> was to put utility-based theory on a firm footing, independent of vague notions of desire, and absent an inconvenient entanglement with psychology. With seminal contributions by <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Houthakker, H. S. (1950). Revealed preference and the utility function. Economica, 17(66), 159–174.')">Houthakker (1950)</span> and others, Samuelson's program was completed: optimization was demonstrably equivalent to a set of compelling and intuitive axioms relating choice across different menus. Moreover, choice behavior could in principle be used to construct the (ordinal) utility function itself. Soon after, this approach would be adopted by <span id="cite" onclick="alert('von Neumann, J. & Morgenstern, O. (1944). Theory of games and economic behavior. Princeton University Press.')">von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944)</span> and <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Savage, L. J. (1954). The Foundations of Statistics. Wiley Publications in Statistics.')">Savage (1954)</span> to similarly motivate the probabilistic representation of uncertainty and maximization of expected utility. Thus, the field of axiomatic decision theory was born.</p>

                <p>Revealed preference is revered by economists. It is not hard to see why. The theory is empirically grounded (and therefore indisputably scientific), making only "assumptions about objects that are directly observable (choice behavior), rather than about things that are not (preferences)'' <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Mas-Colell, A., Whinston, M., & Green, J. R. (1995). Microeconomic theory. Oxford University Press.')">(Mas-Colell et al. 1995, p.5)</span>. Axiomatic analyses are powerful enough to offer precise conclusions, while the overarching framework is flexible enough to accomodate a wide variety of behavioral phenomena, such as ambiguity aversion, temptation, and preferences over the temporal resolution of uncertainty. As a paradigm, revealed preference has organized inquiry into behavior to the point where experimental economists can systematically study and communicate anomalies to decision theorists, who in turn incorporate these findings into their own research. Perhaps most important to its success, Samuelson's campaign largely preserved the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>: it turns out that ordinal utility, objective expected utility, and Bayesian decision theory all have relatively convincing axiomatic foundations.</p>
                
                <p>That is the most charitable presentation. In this short essay, I will argue that this narrative is -- at best -- incomplete. Let us begin with a simple question: <i>in what sense is choice behavior observable?</i></p>

                <p>Recall that a primitive of any axiomatic decision theory is a collection of menus. Each menu is then associated, via the choice correspondence, with some act chosen from that menu. What is the physical entity that each of these menus is supposed to represent? There are at least three possible answers -- three attempted interpretations of the earlier assertion that choice behavior is "directly observed''.
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Choice data is counterfactual</i>. This is a many-worlds interpretation with a single agent, where each menu corresponds to a different reality for said agent. The reality we inhabit is <i>actual</i>, the remainder counterfactual. We can often influence which reality occurs, e.g. by setting prices.</li>
                    <li><i>Choice data is cross-sectional</i>. There are several agents in a single reality, each of whom makes a choice from their own menu. The menus can be assigned randomly in a controlled experiment. But they can also be assigned deterministically by some natural process.</li>
                    <li><i>Choice data is partial</i>. There is a single agent in a single reality, who makes choices from several menus, either simultaneously or sequentially. Every choice that is observed is but one part of the agent's <i>total choice</i>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is reasonable to expect <i>some</i> relationship between these three data sources. Nonetheless, different interpretations will have different implications for the patterns of choice exhibited by self-interested agents. So it is unfortunate that economists rarely make their interpretation explicit.</p>
                
                <p>The cleanest way to interpret axiomatic analysis is that it applies to counterfactual choice data. This is not surprising, because counterfactual choice lacks the one essential feature of revealed preference: observability. After all, there is only one actual reality. <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Manski, C. F. (2011, August). Actualist rationality. Theory and Decision, 71(2), 195–210.')">Manski (2011)</span> already pointed out that your counterfactual choices have no impact on your welfare, and a positive analog applies here: your counterfactual choices cannot be observed. So it is not surprising that, absent a connection with observable data, it is possible to present a comprehensive theory that appeals to our intuition. After all, in the absence of a tight empirical tether, it is our intuition that guides theory development.</p>
                
                <p>This difficulty has been known for a long time in the literature on preference elicitation. The reader may be aware of the so-called <i>random incentive mechanism</i>, in which an agent chooses items from multiple menus but the menu whose item is actually drawn is randomly chosen. This experimental procedure offers a tight link between partial choice and counterfactual choice for agents that are Bayesian <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Karni, E. & Safra, Z. (1987). ‘‘Preference reversal” and the observability of preferences by experimental methods. Econometrica, 55(3), 675–685.\n\nBade, S. (2015). Randomization devices and the elicitation of ambiguity-averse preferences. Journal of Economic Theory, 159, 221–235.')">(Karni and Safra 1987; Bade 2015)</span> and, more generally, under a monotonicity assumption whose conjunction with reduction of compound lotteries implies Bayesianism <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Azrieli, Y., Chambers, C. P., & Healy, P. J. (2018). Incentives in experiments: a theoretical analysis. Journal of Political Economy, 126(4), 1472–1503.')">(Azrieli et al. 2018)</span>. Note that the empirical evidence for this notion of monotonicity is mixed (again, see section 5 of <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Azrieli, Y., Chambers, C. P., & Healy, P. J. (2018). Incentives in experiments: a theoretical analysis. Journal of Political Economy, 126(4), 1472–1503.')">Azrieli et al. 2018</span>). Moreover, reduction of compound lotteries seems normatively appealing -- or at least justifiable -- and is common practice in several fields. And, if you do allow for reduction of compound lotteries, it is straightforward to argue that no partial choice data can distinguish between self-interested agents that are Bayesian from those that are non-Bayesian <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Kuzmics, C. (2017). Abraham Wald’s complete class theorem and Knightian uncertainty. Games and Economic Behavior, 104, 666–673.')">(Kuzmics 2017)</span>. As an answer to our question, the random incentive mechanism strikes me as surprisingly flimsy.</p>

                <p>What else, then? Certainly, controlled experiments can also link cross-sectional choice with counterfactual choice. By randomizing the menus that each experimental subject is asked to choose from, we can identify the population distribution of preferences. But this interpretation of choice data raises two issues.

                    First, we can only learn about preferences at the population level -- not the preferences or beliefs of an individual.<sup><a href="#fone">1</a></sup> Now, I have no reason to think that our representations are indistinguishable or unfalsifiable at the population level. On the contrary, I think they are. But I rarely see decision theorists make that argument formally. And so, because the cross-sectional identification strategy is not made explicit, it's hard to spot issues and it's even harder to argue against it.<sup><a href="#ffour">2</a></sup></p>

                    

                    <p>This brings me to the second issue: just because an object is identified does not mean we are capable of learning it. Naturally, both the model primitives and the representations have become increasingly complicated as the field has responded to challenges from behavioral and experimental economics. Intuitively, more complication means we need more choice observations to get the same amount of identifying power. More observations will require a proportional increase in the number of experimental subjects. And I suspect that common practices (e.g. introducing mixtures of already-complicated acts) will exponentially increase the number of observations required. Indeed, our choice objects and representations are becoming so high-dimensional that I fear they are not statistically falsifiable with anything resembling realistic experiments. The sampling noise (from random subjects) would simply overwhelm the signal.</p>

                
                <p>For decision theorists, then, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that there is no need to dally with the problematic interpretation of counterfactual choice. The bad news is that partial choice, which I view as the leading alternative interpretation, requires a very different sort of analysis. In a future post (time permitting), I will illustrate this formally by characterizing the extent to which a preference-based analysis can succeed in describing the partial choices of a self-interested agent. Given certain functional forms for the agent's utility function -- ranging from the the familiar to the exotic -- there can be substantial structure on the agent's partial choices. It is easy, for example, to motivate a Bayesian representation. But generally, even when highly structured preference representations exist, it seems unlikely that they would arise from a principled axiomatic analysis. Furthermore, while these representations are in some sense robust, the relaxation of restrictions on the agent's utility function does not seem to correspond to any natural relaxation of an axiom.</p>
                
                <p>The conclusion is clear. If economists want to study rational, self-interested behavior while reinterpreting choice data as partial, then (a)  we will preserve some of our current theory via important special cases but (b) axiomatic analysis is <i>not</i> the right way to generalize that theory. What, then, is the right way?</p>

                <p>Here's one possibility, which I consider a minimal departure from current practice. First, we take rationality -- the assumption that agents act in their own best interest -- for what it is: a form of behavior that may or may not apply in a given situation, but at the very least should not be ruled out. All considered, it is a good starting point. Second, we turn our attention to the following question: for a given sequence of menus (or set of possible sequences) and a given restriction on the agent's utility function, which patterns of partial choice are consistent with optimization?</p>
                
                <p>Notably, this question of partial choice can stand on its own -- it does not require a rejection of axiomatic decision theory to be interesting. Solutions can contribute to a theory of revealed preference under non-laboratory conditions; to a theory of preference elicitation for non-Bayesians; to a theory of decentralized decision-making; and to a robust modeling approach that considers whether and how much an agent's behavior can be distorted by the presence of other choices that were not explicitly modeled. Formally, this approach is compatible with any axiomatization of counterfactual choice that leads to some form of optimization. So, why do I feel the need to stir the pot? Why have I presented the partial choice interpretation as a substitute for -- rather than a complement to -- our current practice, which relies on counterfactual choice?</p>
                
                <p>The answer brings me no pleasure, but I fear it is true. When it comes to decision theory, resolving methodological confusion has become a more urgent task than theory development. Eighty years ago, <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Samuelson, P. A. (1938). A note on the pure theory of consumer’s behaviour. Economica, 5(17), 61–71.')">Samuelson (1938)</span> left a loose end and, apparently, no one bothered to tie it up.<sup><a href="#ftwo">3</a></sup> As our profession moved beyond perfect information consumer theory, and onto rougher terrain, the entire garment may have gradually unraveled. It is now a distinct possibility that the field of axiomatic decision theory -- which placed its trust in an assuredly empirical paradigm -- has produced (a) positive theories that verge on the unempirical and (b) normative theories that are either vacuous (as counterfactual choice; again, see <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Manski, C. F. (2011, August). Actualist rationality. Theory and Decision, 71(2), 195–210.')">Manski 2011</span>) or uncompelling (when applied to partial choice).</p>

                <p>If axiomatic decision theory were empirically successful -- that is, if it produced theories that stood up to new experiments rather than theories that explained old experiments -- then we might be justified in overlooking foundational issues in favor of making continued progress. But, as of today, the axiomatic approach has not met that standard. And the observability issues that I've discussed here, as well as other conceptual issues that I haven't, raise the possibility that it never will.<sup><a href="#fthree">4</a></sup> So, let us be resolute in challenging the status quo. Meanwhile, my peers who find methodological debate unproductive can take heart: the characterization of partial choice is a fundamental open question that should have value independent of the debate's resolution.</p>

                 <div class="divider"></div>

                 <p id="footnote"><sup id="fone">1</sup>If we assume that agents are Bayesian with linear utility from monetary rewards, proper scoring rules identify their beliefs. But if we allow the agents to have a set of beliefs (as in e.g. maxmin expected utility), we cannot point identify their belief set. By the complete class theorem, the same is true for any preferences that (a) respect weak dominance and (b) strictly subsume Bayesianism.</p>

                 <p id="footnote"><sup id="ffour">2</sup>The exception that proves the rule: <span id="cite" onclick="alert('Azrieli, Y., Chambers, C. P., & Healy, P. J. (2018). Incentives in experiments: a theoretical analysis. Journal of Political Economy, 126(4), 1472–1503.')">Azrieli et al. (2018)</span>. After they describe a cross-sectional experiment to test their monotonicity axiom, they write, "unfortunately, the statistical power of these tests can be quite low, so a large number of subjects may be needed for the test to be sufficiently informative". This is the second issue that I want to discuss.</p>

                 <p id="footnote"><sup id="ftwo">3</sup>At one point he writes, "if an individual selects batch one over batch two, he does not at the same time select two over one. The meaning of this is perfectly clear and will probably gain ready acquiescence''. Well, the meaning is far from clear, but it was accepted nonetheless.</p>

                 <p id="footnote"><sup id="fthree">4</sup>Here's another issue: state-of-the-art methods for decision-making (developed by computer scientists and statisticians) routinely violate our axioms. And they do so in several distinct ways: by using intransitive choice criteria like minimax regret; by optimizing approximately or on average (over a large class of menus or inputs) rather than exactly; by using proxies like "rate of convergence" or "local power analysis" to arrive at their choice correspondence, rather than setting up an optimization problem. Forget about understanding humanity as a whole; is the axiomatic approach even capable of understanding <i>statisticians</i>? If not, do we really think that our experimental subjects are going to make decisions that are more classically "rational" than the people they hire to make decisions for them?</p>
