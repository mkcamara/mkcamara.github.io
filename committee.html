		<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper incorporates computational constraints into decision theory, via an axiom of computational tractability. I use the resulting framework to better understand common behavioral heuristics, as well as violations of rationality. My representation theorems show that choices satisfying both the rationality and tractability axioms correspond to forms of choice bracketing, a heuristic observed in lab experiments. I also prove a trilemma: for many objective functions cannot simultaneously be rational, tractable, and approximately optimal. This suggests computationally constrained agents may be better off violating standard rationality axioms.</p>

		<p><b>Abstract:</b> 

        A rich class of economic problems—like monopoly regulation, contract design, and Bayesian persuasion—can be understood as games of incomplete information played by a policymaker who commits to a policy and an agent who responds. Typically, optimal policies depend on both the policymaker and the agent’s prior knowledge about the environment. To get around this, researchers often (a) assume that both the policymaker and the agent have substantial prior knowledge, or (b) assume no knowledge and optimize against the worst-case. We propose online learning as a way to combine the superior performance of (a) with the robustness of (b). We study a repeated interaction where both the policymaker and the agent may learn about the environment over time. We develop simple calibrated policies that ensure bounded regret, relative to the best-in-hindsight static policy. Our guarantees are prior-free and hold even in highly non-stationary environments. They require novel behavioral assumptions that capture concepts like "rationality'' or "unpredictability'' without relying on beliefs.</p>

        <p><b>Status:</b> have been working on revision for some time now. Current arxiv version is outdated and not ideal for economists. Finishing will probably take a few weeks of work.</p>

        <p><b>Plans:</b> we wanted to submit to a top-5 journal to start. IIRC Marciano was on board once some things were fixed. Eddie was more pessimistic, which was a major reason for the revision. Would be great to get feedback on the finished draft before submitting.</p>

        <!--<p>A rich class of mechanism design problems can be understood as incomplete-information games between a principal who commits to a policy and an agent who responds, with payoffs determined by an unknown state of the world. Traditionally, these models require strong and often-impractical assumptions about beliefs (a common prior over the state). In this paper, we dispense with the common prior. Instead, we consider a repeated interaction where both the principal and the agent may learn over time from the state history. We reformulate mechanism design as a reinforcement learning problem and develop mechanisms that attain natural benchmarks without any assumptions on the state-generating process. Our results make use of novel behavioral assumptions for the agent -- based on <i>counterfactual calibration</i> -- that capture the spirit of rationality without relying on beliefs.</p>-->

		<p><b>Abstract:</b> In many settings, understanding an agent's beliefs can be the difference between a successful policy and one that fails dramatically.
        Unfortunately, in many instances, the rich behavioral or survey data needed to identify an agent's beliefs may not be available.
        In this paper, I propose a modeling assumption that bypasses this issue, and show that it can highlight important policy trade-offs not captured by existing models.
        The core idea is straightforward: if the available data convincingly demonstrates some fact about the world, the agent should believe that fact.
        Otherwise, her beliefs are left unspecified. I develop this approach in the context of incomplete-information games where a policymaker commits to a policy, an agent responds, and both have access to a public dataset.
        It turns out that policies that are too complex may be suboptimal because they lead to unpredictable behavior.
        To balance the benefits of policy complexity with its costs, I develop a method called strategic regularization and motivate it through both theoretical guarantees and illustrative examples.</p>

		<p><b>Status:</b> Draft is almost ready for arxiv. The only outstanding item are the last two subsections (two of the illustrative examples) need to be written up. That will probably take a few days of work.</p>

		<p><b>Plans:</b> planning to submit to Economics & Computation conference to start (February deadline). That will give me plenty of time to get feedback before submitting to journal.</p>
        
        <h2>Work-in-Progress</h2>
        I will need to think about what work in progress I want to list, if any. 
        I have four projects (three collaborative) with some kind of theorem or worked through example.
        But none are anywhere close to a working draft.

                <h3>Dissertation Research</h3>

                <p>Economists predict behavior using a simple identifying assumption: that economic agents act in their own best interest. We tend to define "best interest" narrowly enough to derive useful conclusions from a given model, but broadly enough to include certain behaviors that we see empirically. Along the way, we acknowledge that many of our models assume a level of competence that we ourselves would find difficult to satisfy. But only rarely do we take advantage of the fact that statisticians and computer scientists have spent decades formalizing the ways in which decision problems are difficult, and characterizing the difficulty that state-of-the-art methods can handle.</p>

                <p>So: can we leverage theories of complexity to weaken or strengthen our behavioral assumptions in a way that (a) makes our theory more credible, where needed, (b) justifies existing theory, where possible, and (c) modifies our predictions appropriately as a problem becomes more complicated? Can these revised models explain real-world phenomena that are difficult or impossible to express via existing models? My dissertation research answers these questions affirmatively.</p>

                <p>In particular, my work uses a three-step methodology to revise classic models in mechanism design and decision theory. It is easy to describe in the abstract (although the execution can be more intricate). Given an existing model:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Figure out what we're asking agents to do and how real-world experts would accomplish that task.</li>
                    <li>Identify the performance benchmarks that real-world experts can guarantee (resp. that are impossible to achieve).</li>
                    <li>Assume that agents weakly overperform (resp. strictly underperform) those benchmarks.</li>
                </ol>
