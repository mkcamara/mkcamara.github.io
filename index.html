        <h4>Computationally Tractable Choice</h4>
        <!--<h5>Previously known as <i>High-Dimensional Decision Theory</i></h5>-->
        <h5>New draft coming soon.</h5>

        <p>
        I incorporate computational constraints into decision theory in order to capture how cognitive limitations affect behavior. I impose an axiom of computational tractability that rules out behaviors that are thought to be fundamentally hard. I use the resulting framework to better understand behavioral heuristics observed in lab experiments, by showing that tractable choices satisfying the expected utility axioms correspond to forms of choice bracketing. Then I show that a computationally-constrained decisionmaker may obtain much better outcomes if she is willing to use heuristics that violate the expected utility axioms.</p>

        <!--<p>A rich class of mechanism design problems can be understood as incomplete-information games between a principal who commits to a policy and an agent who responds, with payoffs determined by an unknown state of the world. Traditionally, these models require strong and often-impractical assumptions about beliefs (a common prior over the state). In this paper, we dispense with the common prior. Instead, we consider a repeated interaction where both the principal and the agent may learn over time from the state history. We reformulate mechanism design as a reinforcement learning problem and develop mechanisms that attain natural benchmarks without any assumptions on the state-generating process. Our results make use of novel behavioral assumptions for the agent -- based on <i>counterfactual calibration</i> -- that capture the spirit of rationality without relying on beliefs.</p>-->

        <p>This paper studies a rich class of single-agent policy design problems that includes monopoly regulation, contract design, and Bayesian persuasion as special cases.
		Most existing solutions either (a) assume a common prior belief over the environment, or (b) make no prior knowledge assumptions and optimize against the worst case.
		We show that, in repeated settings with rich feedback, we can approximate the superior performance of (a) while preserving the robustness of (b).
		We develop simple calibrated policies that ensure vanishing or bounded regret, relative to the ex-post-optimal static policy.
		Our guarantees are prior-free and hold even in highly non-stationary environments.
		They rely on novel behavioral assumptions that capture concepts like ``rationality'' or ``unpredictability'' without relying on beliefs.</p>

        <h4>Mechanism Design with a Common Dataset</h4>
        <h5>New draft coming soon.</h5>
        <p>
        I propose a new approach to mechanism design: rather than assume a common prior belief, assume access to a common dataset. I restrict attention to incomplete information games where a policymaker commits to a policy and a single agent responds, and design a data-driven policy that performs well under weak assumptions on how quickly the agent learns. Policies that are too complex, in a precise sense, may be suboptimal because they lead to unpredictable responses by the agent. My approach leads to new insights in models of vaccine distribution, prescription drug approval, performance pay, and product bundling.</p>

                <h3>Dissertation Research</h3>

                <p>Economists predict behavior using a simple identifying assumption: that economic agents act in their own best interest. We tend to define "best interest" narrowly enough to derive useful conclusions from a given model, but broadly enough to include certain behaviors that we see empirically. Along the way, we acknowledge that many of our models assume a level of competence that we ourselves would find difficult to satisfy. But only rarely do we take advantage of the fact that statisticians and computer scientists have spent decades formalizing the ways in which decision problems are difficult, and characterizing the difficulty that state-of-the-art methods can handle.</p>

                <p>So: can we leverage theories of complexity to weaken or strengthen our behavioral assumptions in a way that (a) makes our theory more credible, where needed, (b) justifies existing theory, where possible, and (c) modifies our predictions appropriately as a problem becomes more complicated? Can these revised models explain real-world phenomena that are difficult or impossible to express via existing models? My dissertation research answers these questions affirmatively.</p>

                <p>In particular, my work uses a three-step methodology to revise classic models in mechanism design and decision theory. It is easy to describe in the abstract (although the execution can be more intricate). Given an existing model:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Figure out what we're asking agents to do and how real-world experts would accomplish that task.</li>
                    <li>Identify the performance benchmarks that real-world experts can guarantee (resp. that are impossible to achieve).</li>
                    <li>Assume that agents weakly overperform (resp. strictly underperform) those benchmarks.</li>
                </ol>
